<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Anti-Roll Bar Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Original Equipment Manufacturers</li><li>Aftermarket</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Anti-Roll Bar Market includes two types: Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) and Aftermarket. OEMs refer to the manufacturers that produce and supply anti-roll bars directly to vehicle manufacturers. These bars are then installed in new vehicles during the production process. On the other hand, Aftermarket refers to the market where anti-roll bars are offered by third-party manufacturers or suppliers as replacements or upgrades for existing vehicles. Aftermarket anti-roll bars can be purchased separately and added to a vehicle after its initial sale.</p></p>
