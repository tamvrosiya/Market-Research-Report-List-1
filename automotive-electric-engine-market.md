<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Electric Engine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>DC Motor</li><li>AC Motor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive electric engine market consists of two main types: DC motors and AC motors. A DC motor, or direct current motor, operates by converting electrical energy into mechanical energy through the use of a magnetic field. It is commonly used in electric vehicles due to its simplicity, efficiency, and ability to provide high torque at low speeds. On the other hand, an AC motor, or alternating current motor, operates by constantly changing the direction of electrical current, which allows it to be more efficient and less complex than DC motors. AC motors are widely used in hybrid and plug-in hybrid vehicles.</p></p>
