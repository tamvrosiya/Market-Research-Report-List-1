<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Ignitor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact-controlled Ignition System</li><li>Breakless Ignition System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive ignitor market consists of two main types: contact-controlled ignition systems and breakless ignition systems. Contact-controlled ignition systems use mechanical points to control the timing of the spark plug, allowing for precise ignition timing. On the other hand, breakless ignition systems use electronic sensors to monitor the position of the crankshaft and automatically trigger the spark plug at the correct time. Both systems aim to provide efficient and reliable ignition for automobiles, but the breakless ignition system offers enhanced accuracy and durability compared to contact-controlled ignition systems.</p></p>
