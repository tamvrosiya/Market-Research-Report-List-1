<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Benchtop Dental Air Polisher Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Abrasion Polishing</li><li>Erosion Polishing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Benchtop dental air polishers are categorized into two main types: abrasion polishing and erosion polishing. Abrasion polishing involves the use of abrasive particles to remove stains and plaque from the teeth. It involves the physical scraping or rubbing action on the tooth surface. On the other hand, erosion polishing uses a slurry containing acidic solutions to dissolve the stains and deposits on the teeth. This process chemically breaks down the stains, resulting in a cleaner tooth surface. Both types are effective in dental cleaning but employ different techniques.</p></p>
