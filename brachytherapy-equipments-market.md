<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Brachytherapy Equipments Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>High Dose Rate</li><li>Low Dose Rate</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Brachytherapy is a type of radiation therapy that involves placing radioactive sources directly into the tumor site. The Brachytherapy Equipments market can be classified into two types: High Dose Rate (HDR) and Low Dose Rate (LDR). HDR brachytherapy involves the use of a high dose of radiation for a short period of time, usually delivered through a remote-afterloading system. On the other hand, LDR brachytherapy delivers a low continuous dose of radiation over a longer period using seeds or pellets implanted in the patient's body. Both techniques have their own advantages and are used based on the specific needs of the patient.</p></p>
