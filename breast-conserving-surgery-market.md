<p><h1>Global Breast-Conserving Surgery Market Size and Market Trends: Insights and Projections from 2023 to 2030</h1></p><p><strong>Market Overview and Report Coverage</strong></p>
<p><p>Breast-conserving surgery, also known as lumpectomy or partial mastectomy, is a surgical procedure used to remove cancerous tumors from the breast while preserving the surrounding healthy tissue. In this procedure, only the tumor along with a small margin of healthy tissue is removed, rather than removing the entire breast. This approach aims to achieve the same survival rates as mastectomy while providing a more cosmetically acceptable outcome.</p><p>The breast-conserving surgery market is expected to witness significant growth in the coming years. Increasing awareness about breast cancer, advancements in surgical techniques, and the rising preference for minimally invasive procedures are driving the demand for breast-conserving surgeries. Additionally, the growing focus on personalized medicine and advancements in imaging technology have improved the accuracy of tumor identification, enabling precise and effective breast-conserving surgeries.</p><p>Furthermore, the rising incidence of breast cancer, particularly among women in the reproductive age group, is fueling the demand for breast-conserving surgery. The procedure offers several benefits such as maintenance of breast shape and volume, reduced psychological impact, shorter hospital stay, and quicker recovery compared to mastectomy.</p><p>Moreover, favorable reimbursement policies, government initiatives promoting early detection and diagnosis of breast cancer, and increasing healthcare expenditure further support the growth of the breast-conserving surgery market.</p><p>Overall, with the increasing adoption of breast-conserving surgery, advancements in surgical techniques, and the rising incidence of breast cancer, the breast-conserving surgery market is expected to witness substantial growth in the forecasted period. The market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 13.9%, indicating a promising future for breast-conserving surgeries.</p></p>
