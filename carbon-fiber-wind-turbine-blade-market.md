<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Carbon Fiber Wind Turbine Blade Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hand Lay-Up Molding</li><li>Resin Transfer Molding</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The carbon fiber wind turbine blade market can be categorized into two types: hand lay-up molding and resin transfer molding (RTM). Hand lay-up molding involves manually placing layers of carbon fibers on a mold and applying resin through a brush or roller. This method is relatively low-cost but has limited precision. On the other hand, RTM involves injecting resin into a closed mold containing fibers. RTM is more expensive but allows for better control of the fiber orientation and higher blade quality.</p></p>
