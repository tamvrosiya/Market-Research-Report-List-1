<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flame Retardant for Aerospace Plastics Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Additive</li><li>Reactive</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Flame retardants for aerospace plastics can be categorized into two types: additive and reactive. Additive flame retardants are materials that are added to plastics during their manufacturing process. They work by releasing chemical reactions that inhibit the spread of flames. On the other hand, reactive flame retardants are integrated into the polymer chains during the production stage, making them an integral part of the plastic material itself. These types of flame retardants provide a more permanent and durable flame retardancy to aerospace plastics, enhancing their safety and performance in critical applications.</p></p>
