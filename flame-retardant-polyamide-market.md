<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flame Retardant Polyamide Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Halogen Type</li><li>Halogen Free Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The flame retardant polyamide market is divided into two types: halogen type and halogen-free type. Halogen type polyamides use halogen-containing compounds to achieve flame retardancy. These compounds release halogen gas when exposed to fire, which suppresses the combustion process. On the other hand, halogen-free type polyamides utilize non-halogen compounds to achieve flame retardancy. Although these compounds do not emit harmful gases during combustion, they still provide effective fire resistance. This differentiation allows customers to choose between different types based on their specific needs and considerations.</p></p>
