<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Geogrid Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Uniaxial</li><li>Biaxial</li><li>Triaxial</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Geogrids are a type of geosynthetic material used in civil engineering projects. They are classified into three main types: uniaxial, biaxial, and triaxial. </p><p>Uniaxial geogrids have oriented apertures, allowing them to resist forces in one direction. They are commonly used for soil stabilization in highway construction and retaining walls.</p><p>Biaxial geogrids have equal strength in both primary directions and are suitable for applications requiring reinforcement in multiple directions. They are used in road construction, slope reinforcement, and erosion control.</p><p>Triaxial geogrids have strength in all directions and are designed for high-load applications. They provide improved stability and load distribution, making them suitable for applications such as heavy-duty pavement design and reinforcement of large embankments.</p></p>
