<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Karl Fischer Titration Reagent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Volumetric Reagent</li><li>Coulometric Reagent</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Karl Fischer titration is a commonly used method to determine the water content in various substances. The Karl Fischer titration reagents can be divided into two types: volumetric reagents and coulometric reagents. Volumetric reagents are used in the volumetric Karl Fischer titration method, where the reagent is added in a controlled amount until the water content is completely reacted. Coulometric reagents, on the other hand, are used in the coulometric Karl Fischer titration method, which measures the amount of electricity required to react with the water content in the sample. Both types of reagents play a vital role in accurately measuring the water content.</p></p>
