<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Parkinson's Disease (PD) Drugs Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dopamine Agonist</li><li>Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors</li><li>Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitors</li><li>Glutamate Inhibitors</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Parkinson's Disease (PD) drugs market is categorized into different types based on the mechanism of action. Dopamine agonists simulate the effects of dopamine, a neurotransmitter that is deficient in PD patients. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors prevent the breakdown of dopamine in the brain. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors increase the level of acetylcholine, another neurotransmitter involved in movement control. Glutamate inhibitors reduce the activity of glutamate, an excitatory neurotransmitter. These drugs aim to alleviate PD symptoms and improve quality of life for patients by targeting specific neurotransmitter imbalances in the brain.</p></p>
