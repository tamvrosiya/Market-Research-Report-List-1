<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PCB UV Photosensitive Inks Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Liquid Photosensitive</li><li>Uv Cured</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>PCB UV photosensitive inks are used in the manufacturing of printed circuit boards. Liquid photosensitive inks are the most common type and are applied to the board as a liquid. They are then exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light, which causes them to harden and form a protective layer. On the other hand, UV-cured inks are already hardened and come in the form of a film or sheet. They are applied to the board and then exposed to UV light to create a strong, durable coating. Both types of inks offer efficient and precise PCB production.</p></p>
