<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Radio-TLC Scanner Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dual Collimator</li><li>Single Collimator</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Radio-TLC scanner market offers two main types: Dual Collimator and Single Collimator. In Dual Collimator scanners, two separate collimators are employed to detect radioactivity from samples, resulting in increased sensitivity and accuracy. These scanners are ideal for applications that require precise measurements and analysis. On the other hand, Single Collimator scanners use only one collimator, making them more affordable and suitable for general-purpose use. While they may have slightly lower sensitivity compared to Dual Collimator scanners, they still provide reliable results for various research and routine applications.</p></p>
