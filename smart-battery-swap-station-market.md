<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Smart Battery Swap Station Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Chassis Battery Swap Mode</li><li>Sub-Box Battery Replacement Mode</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Smart Battery Swap Station market includes two main types: Chassis Battery Swap Mode and Sub-Box Battery Replacement Mode. In the Chassis Battery Swap Mode, the entire battery is swapped out from the vehicle's chassis, and a fully charged battery is installed instead. This mode is commonly used in electric vehicles, offering a quick and convenient way to replace batteries and minimize downtime. On the other hand, the Sub-Box Battery Replacement Mode involves replacing individual battery modules within a sub-box rather than swapping out the entire battery. This mode allows for more flexibility and customization in battery management.</p></p>
