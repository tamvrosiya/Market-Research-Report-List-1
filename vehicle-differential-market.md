<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vehicle Differential Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Differential</li><li>Limited-Slip Differential</li><li>Locking Differential</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The vehicle differential market can be categorized into three types: open differential, limited-slip differential, and locking differential. An open differential transfers power to the wheel with the least resistance, resulting in better maneuverability but can cause wheel slippage. A limited-slip differential uses a mechanism to distribute power between wheels, improving traction and minimizing slippage. Lastly, a locking differential allows both wheels to receive equal power, enhancing off-road capabilities but reducing maneuverability on paved surfaces. These differential types vary in their ability to balance wheel traction, maneuverability, and off-road performance.</p></p>
