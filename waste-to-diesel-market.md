<p><strong>The Waste To Diesel Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Gasification</li><li>Pyrolysis</li><li>Depolymerisation</li><li>Incineration</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Waste to Diesel refers to the conversion of waste materials into diesel fuel. Gasification involves converting waste into a gas by using high temperatures in a controlled environment. Pyrolysis is a thermal decomposition process that converts waste into liquid fuel by heating it in the absence of oxygen. Depolymerisation breaks down waste into its basic molecular components for further processing. Incineration is the combustion of waste at high temperatures, producing heat, which can be used to generate power. These technologies offer sustainable solutions for waste management and renewable fuel production.</p></p>
